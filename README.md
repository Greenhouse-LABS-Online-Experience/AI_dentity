# The story
We created a dynamic story where player choices affect the story. We did this with Whimiscal, a flowchart tool.

Do you want to know more about the story, or how we created it? Send me a message and I can share the flowcharts!

# Frameworks used
For AI_dentity, we will use the framework BotUI. This is a framework that lets you easily create a chatbot. We will however be making changes to this framework to make it suit our needs.
