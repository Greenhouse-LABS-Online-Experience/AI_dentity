                        <h1>Creating user friendly media experiences</h1>
                        <p>Working on different mediums to create an engaging experience for users is something I love
                            to do. Wheter it is a website,
                            an app or a media installation, building something with the users in mind has proven to be
                            incredibily important.
                            <br><br>
                            In the three years I have spend at Fontys University for Applied Sciences I learned a lot
                            about design, coding and
                            user experience design. Each semester I made various projects, some more experimental, some
                            more fleshed out and presentable.
                            In this portfolio you will find the projects I am most proud of. These projects are mostly
                            done in groups and I want to thank
                            all the groupmates I have had the pleusure of working with, it were some incredible times!

                            so images or videos might be in Dutch.

                            <h1>Sharify: Simplify Sharing</h1>
                            <p>Sharify was a joint effort with my classmate Mees Salomé. Both of us loved music, but
                                there was a problem: he has Apple Music and I have Spotify...
                                <br><br>
                                We saw more people struggling with this problem and decided that we wanted to
                                develop
                                an app that lets you share music streaming links without having to worry which
                                Streaming Service the other person has.
                                <br><br>
                                We had the chance to further develop this project in the next semester with some
                                extra
                                classmates and a real client.

                        <h1>Sharify: Simplify Sharing</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class="modal-body">
                        <p>For Sharify we wanted a familiar look and feel. The user experience shouldn't be that
                            different from other streaming apps like Apple Music or Spotify. We analyzed these apps and
                            came up with our own design guidelines how we wanted to app to look like.
                            <br><br>
                            It was very easy to usertest this app because most people are familiar with music-streaming
                            services and as far as interaction went, they did not need a lot of assistance. People were
                            enthusiastic about the idea of the app and told us it was a very useful tool for music
                            lovers.
                            <br><br>
                            At the end of the semester we wanted a high fidelity prototype to show our teachers and
                            the
                            client. During this process,
                            we were also developing an actual app that used Spotify's API to match text to albums
                            and
                            tracks. This way we could share a
                            link via Apple Music, get the song values and "translate" it into Spotify.
                            <br><br>
                            To pitch our concept to our classmates, the teachers and the client, I created a video
                            showing the members of
                            our group explaining what the problem is we want to tackle and in what way we wanted to
                            do
                            that.
                            <br><br>
                            The video is available on this page, sadly, we only made a Dutch variant.

                            <p>Quantified Student asked us to create a prototype app that learns students to focus
                                more
                                on

                                With a group of student of different expertises and a lot of research, we created a
                                prototype app which would
                                be presented at the Quantified Student Conference.
                                For the conference I created a video explaining our prototype. The video became a big
                                success
                                at the conference and has been used in various Quantified Student media.

                            assignment me and my groupmates decided to take a look in the mirror and ask what would
                            distract us. With years of experience under our belts, we were confident we would create
                            something great!
                            <br><br>
                            The idea of an app that tracks your study sessions was very compelling to us. We all would
                            like this kind of app to track our own studying sessions and we noticed that tracking data
                            was popular amongst the smartphone community. You can track your steps, heart rate and sport
                            sessions. From the time you use your phone in a day to how many minutes of YouTube videos
                            you watched is all trackable. Why wouldn't your study session be trackable?
                            <br><br>
                            At the end of the semester we wanted a high fidelity prototype build that would feature
                            our
                            desired tracking data. This data
                            would be stuff like the noise levels in your session, times you picked up your phone and
                            notifications you would get. While we were building
                            this prototype we were also developing a real app that would track your surrounding
                            noise in
                            a session.
                            <br><br>
                            At the end of the semester was the Quantified Student Day. The video is attached to this
                            page. It was a great
                            success and even made it to various Quantified Student media outlets.

                            <p>In this project I build a chatbot for 123autoparts.nl. The chatbot would ask you
                                questions to see what
                                the problem is with your car. It would do this by asking various questions about
                                your car and go deep into the problems you were having, always keeping it understandable
                                for everyone.

                        <p>We got a task to build a chatbot and there wasn't a specific company or assignment
                            linked to is.
                            Our client worked together with a lot of companies and one of them was
                            123autoparts.nl. On this
                            site you can order various car parts for your old or new car.

                            We got the idea to build a chatbot that would ask you questions is you did not know what
                            exactly was wrong with your car. This way we wanted to let the user check what the problem
                            is themselves and not immediately go to the garage. Of course, if the user would not be able
                            to see what the problem is he or she could always contact 123autoparts or go to the garage
                            anyway.

                            "Keynote". Because of this I wanted to show off my skills in the last presentation of the
                            year and tried
                            my best to make a well designed, compelling presentation for our classmates, clients and

                            <p>Futuris helps people who need care- and or work guidance. They offer housing and
                                workplaces for people with a developmental disorder. The only problem is that some of
                                their clients do not show up for their work because they are not motivated enough.
                                <br><br>
                                Our solution was to create an app that lets clients collect digital currency,
                                or
                                Schmeckle's,
                                and let them trade those in for small extra's at work. Clients gather
                                Schmeckle's
                                for the time they are working.
                                If a client works for an amount of days in a row, they will gain streaks an
                                other
                                bonuses.

                        <p>The task that Futuris gave us was simple: make a fun tool that inspires our clients to go
                            to
                            work.
                            Most of the clients have autism or a mental handicap and because Futuris provides them
                            with
                            housing they need
                            to have a job. Futuris provides those jobs, but the clients aren't familiar with the
                            concept
                            of working
                            and showing up on time for that. Futuris tries to help them with that, but also has
                            their
                            hands full of other
                            matters in the housing itself.
                            <br><br>
                            Through interviews we found out that a lot of the clients would play video games in
                            their
                            spare time. Most of
                            them would do this until late in the night and because of this would show up late or
                            wouldn't show up at all at their
                            workplaces. It seemed like a good idea to motivate them to go to work with some sort of
                            game, they enjoyed them in their
                            free time, so maybe they'll get hooked on a mobile motivation game!
                            <br><br>
                            We build this mobile as a high fidelity prototype and showed this to Futuris. They were
                            enthusiastic and wanted to see if we could realize this in code. Because at this point there
                            wasn't that much time left we decided to build the app in React. We converted our designs
                            into this new space and around that we build a presentation to show our exact concept and
                            designs/prototype. The video attached is that final presentation.

                        <p>For this assignment, it was clear we needed to make a dashboard in a desktop website. Because
                            filling in the different forms
                            was an important and time consuming task, we felt that this would be done on a desktop
                            rather than on a phone or tablet.
                            The essential idea of the assignment was to translate the Excel sheets to a fully
                            functioning web version.
                            <br><br>
                            We started by setting up a database system in PHP and worked from there to create a fully
                            functioning back-end, this was the part
                            I mostly partook in. I also helped out creating some parts of the front-end.
                            <br><br>
                            It was very interesting testing this tool with the start-ups that BW-Ventures were actually
                            helping, they gave very useful insights.
                            With the help of these user tests we were able to create a tool that would help these
                            start-ups the best way possible.

                            <br><br>
                            For the final presentation of our tool, a classmate and I created a video to accompany our
                            product. He did the visuals for the
                            video and I came up with the concepts.

                            <h1>User Testing Tool</h1>
                            <p>For my internship assignment I had to create a user testing tool that would make user
                                testing more
                                accessible and easy to do and archive.
                                <br><br>
                                For this assignment is did a lot of research about user testing in general and about ux,
                                to make the tool
                                accessible to anyone. I also tested the tool a lot in the company itself to make sure it
                                was up to their standards
                                and their wishes!

                        <p>The process of making user testing accessible was challenging. After doing extensive research
                            I finally started
                            building the tool. For this I used mainly PHP and Javascript. When the database was set up I
                            started working on the front-end
                            and translating my research into the tool.
                            <br><br>
                            This process was the most time consuming. Making sure the tool had all the big user testing
                            methods while being understandable for the company
                            and the way they handled user tests. Testing the tool with my colleagues helped a lot, the
                            tool was built for them in the end.
                            <br><br>

                            The final product was well received and I got a good grade for my internship. You can read my internship report

                            <p>The goal of Stallcatchers is to help contribute to Alzheimer research. My contribution
                                was to build a landingpage
                                for the Stallcatchers website!

                                I also created a t-shirt that was givin to Stallcatcher players during the Games For

                            When you play Stallcatchers you are trying to see if the veins of the brains of mice aren't
                            glugged. When you see
                            one that doesn't flow all the way you hit the spot and the time when it happened. When a lot
                            of users notice the same
                            stall, the video is sent to Alzheimer researches to add this to their research. Want to try

                            are listed on the back of the shirt. The way they are designed is to make them appear as the

                            they are trying to catch.

                            <p>Taking photos always was a hobby of mine. But recently, analog photography caught

                                attention. Analog photography
                                is taking pictures on film and letting them be developed. Every picture you take
                                counts as there are about 36 pictures
                                on one roll of film!
